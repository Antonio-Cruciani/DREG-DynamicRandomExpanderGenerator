# Dynamic Random Graph Generator

 This is a function package for people interested in studying graphs that evolve over time. Anyone with a basic understanding of Python can create their own dynamic graph.

## RAES
Dynamic Random Graph $$ \mathcal{G}(n,d,c) $$ where:

-	$n$ is the number of vertices 
-  $d$ is the minimum required degree in the graph
-  $c$ is the tolerance ($c\cdot d $= Max Degree in the graph)

RAES evolves over time following the following rules:
